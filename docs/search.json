Now a mapmaker, she spent several years working as an environmental scientist in a small Florida town notorious for Florida Man stories. Her work focuses on mental illness, queer identity, and environmental themes.\nShe is the author of A History of Unnatural Disasters, a YA contemporary in which a boy starts a true crime podcast about his own mother, and Snaketown, Florida, a YA contemporary in which two teen girls try to put their town in the map in the worst way possible—by staging a (fake) disaster."

Turns out, the real illness was his mother’s: Munchausen syndrome by proxy. And when the story hits the headlines, suddenly everyone and their pet iguana has an opinion about him and his family. The worst one? That he was in on the fakery.\nAlex tells himself it’s nothing. But the trial is soon, and if the whole world believes he was in on it, then his mom might get off free—throwing their family into chaos. All he wants to do is take control of the story. To do this, he settles on what is clearly the most logical idea: starting a true crime podcast… about his own mother.\nRunning the podcast means spilling all his family’s messy, messy guts, down to every whispered word and midnight dose. But as Alex digs more into the nightmare that engulfed his family, he finds that there are some secrets he wasn’t ready to know—and that could tear an already-battered home to shreds."

Where people find abandoned rocket launchers in the canal, a man raises pythons for a living, and most importantly, no one cares that June has severe psychosis. But when outsiders look at Sunset Springs, all they see is abandoned backwater. And in thirty days, megacorporation Hydrocell will flood the town as part of a water diversion project to save prime beachfront real estate—and wipe Sunset Springs off the map.\nJune knows the town is worth everything—she just has to prove it. So she and her girlfriend Cecily come up with a brilliant idea: they’ll turn it into a tourist attraction. But the only thing that will bring outsiders to boggy, mosquito-infested Sunset Springs is good old-fashioned Floridian chaos. Together they hatch a plan to stage their very own Florida Man story by unleashing hundreds of pythons on the town as part of a (fake) revenge plot. Soon, Sunset Springs goes viral, and huge crowds arrive to capture the ensuing crisis on social media.\nBut when various townspeople try to take the story into their own hands, things spiral out of control, and secrets risk being exposed. Worse, June begins to suspect Cecily’s motives are more complicated—and that she isn’t trying to save the town at all.\nSnaketown, Florida will be available Summer 2027 from Holiday House."
