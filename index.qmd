Karen Myna Cantor is a Young Adult fiction writer based on the East Coast. Now a mapmaker, she spent several years working as an environmental scientist in a small Florida town notorious for Florida Man stories. Her work focuses on mental illness, queer identity, and environmental themes.

She is the author of *Alex, by Proxy*, a YA contemporary in which a boy starts a true crime podcast about his own mother, and *Snaketown, Florida*, a YA contemporary in which two teen girls try to put their town in the map in the worst way possibleâ€”by staging a (fake) disaster.
